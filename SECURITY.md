# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for
receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| CVSS v3.0 | Supported Versions                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 9.0-10.0  | Releases within the previous three months if possible |
| 4.0-8.9   | Most recent release                       |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities by creating a [issue](https://github.com/stevleibelt/arch-linux-live-cd-iso-with-zfs/issues)-ticket.
We will try to take care as fast as possible. Keep in mind that this is a hobby project.
